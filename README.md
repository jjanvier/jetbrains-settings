This repo allows to sync our PhpStorm IDE configurations.
 
It comes from my `pim-enterprive-dev` configuration.

The documentation of this feature is located [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#settings-repository).

If you want to use this configuration on your PC:

> On each computer where you want your settings to be applied, in the Settings/Preferences dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S), expand the Tools node and choose Settings Repository. Specify the URL of the repository you've created, and click Overwrite Local.
>
> You can click Merge if you want the repository to keep a combination of the remote settings and your local settings. If any conflicts are detected, a dialog will be displayed where you can resolve these conflicts.
